# ðŸ§ª Alchemy!

Alchemy is a small set of TypeScript utilities which can help in solving tedious tasks that I've faced in my development career.

I decided to publish this because I wanted to share my code with the world and helping other people in case they ever faced similar problems and wanted to solve them easily.

Thanks for passing by! Check the GitHub repo if you have suggestions!
